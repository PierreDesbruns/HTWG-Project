OldVersion folder:
     > Contains an old version of PCA in which eigenvalues are selected individually;
     > Contains pictures and results of the old version (threshold = 0.1 and 0.5);
     > Threshold corresponds to minimal purcentage of covariance matrix trace that eigenvalues must deal with;
     > The lower the threshold, the fewer the errors;
     > NO LONGER CONSIDERED FOR ANALYSIS

NewVersion folder:
     > Contains the new version of PCA in which eigenvalues are selected regarding their place in covariance matrix;
     > Contains pictures and results of the new version (threshold = 0.99);
     > Threshold corresponds to minimal purcentage of covariance matrix trace the sum of first eigenvalues must deal with;
     > The higher the threshold, the fewer the errors;
     > CONSIDERED FOR ANALYSIS
